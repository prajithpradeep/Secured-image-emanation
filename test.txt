My first visit for the lunch meal/thali/sadya was on Thiru Onam (September, 2019). I thought the meal was just special on that day.  Today, I went again. Once again, the sadya was simply special---that too, with four payasams! Apart from that, 4 pickles, 4 curd-based curries, 4 vegetable dishes, banana-chips-n-jaggery savoury, papad, banana, choice of white or chamba rice, parippu/dal with as much ghee you want, sambhar, buttermilk, moru and rasam. All unlimited, even payasam. Have I missed anything?  But, what stood out today is the service. Do you know another place (packed with people) where the owner attends to customers? He even brought a basket of papads for us when he saw that one of us enjoyed papad with payasam. We did not even ask for it. His employees/colleagues seemed to share the same enthusiasm, right down to the person assisting at the car park in front. They were that attentive. They brought extra bananas, served with a smile, even had time to joke with us, made sure we enjoyed a Kerala sadya the way it should be enjoyed. I have never felt so satisfied at a place.
It was interesting to be there with my guests for a Kerala Style Sadya... On a plantain leaf, it was served with a range of dishes and 4 different varieties of payasam( a typical kerala sweet dessert, in a rather liquid form) The other curries and the quality of serving did not match the style and grandeur of the meal, still it was a great experience. The suppliers were taking short cut to serve above the plate of the guy sitting next to you, rather than coming to your side and serving in proper manner.
One of the best place in Kerala to have variety of dosa. Nice place for comfortable family dining, in budget way
Super vegetarian restaurant. Everyday kerala traditional feast is served. So many dishes with payasam
Overall good experience,parking space available good hygiene and air condition hall..variety of dosa also available other than their Sadhya which I liked most must visit with when in trivendram
The lunch menu which resembles the traditional onam sadhya of kerala is their main attraction. Such is the taste, that you will bee prompted to order more.
Schezwan Dosa, that too 3 in number I had. One hell of a dosa it was. Their dosa varieties are very famous I think. Person nearby my seat was also ordering some variety of dosa from their menu.
I am heavily amazed by the varieties, Schezwan, mysore masala dosa, I had these two and the taste is simply spell binding. All were in awe of the lunch, but am in awe of the dosas here.
We went for dinner and as soon as we entered we realised that it was a huge mistake to come. Place was overcrowded to say the least. Limited food options and weird looking drink being served to all the customers. We were so put off that we didn’t order and left.
Mothers Vedge is the best place to get sadhia. Served on a banana leave with outstanding quality. On sadhia is 180 INR and it’s worth it.
Great food and great staff. Delicious. Easily reachable by auto. Had a great time. Payasams are great
How can they serve such sadya(Meals in Malayalam) all the days, that too these many cuisines. 4 type of kheers? Heavenly experience. Please do visit.
365 days a year lunch, 4 paayasam, immensely tasty cusines. Ho, my mouth is full of water now. Must must go to place.
Had a evening tea/dinner there... Dosas and puri were good.. tried uthappam which was not good... was able to find park right in front of hotel... There was a little bit of wait time for someo e to take the orders but after that it was all smooth...
Been to this restaurant for a couple of times to indulge in some delicious vegetarian food. Different types of dosas are the main speciality. To add on to that, a special emotion to the Sadhya available on all the 365 calendar days and it’s just for ₹180, which I believe is quite reasonable for the quantity of the food. My personal favorite dosas are Podi Dosa, Cheese Dosa and Jini Dosa.
We placed order for two Onam Sadhya. Full Payment of close to Rs. 900 per person [yes you read it right. It was a total of whooping Rs. 1800 for 2 packs] was collected earlier itself[when we tool the coupons]. My dad went to collect the Sadhya by 11:30 AM since we were told while collecting the coupons that the Sadhya would be ready by then. There were close to 100 people already in the queue by then.  Within 30 mins, the queue grew to more than 200, I believe. They did not have the food / parcels ready by then. All the people who were supposed to pack food was busy serving Sadhya to the people inside. As per my understanding, since the money for parcel was already collected[two days in advance], they were concentrating on the live Sadhya serving since it would be the current profit which they would be getting.  I had been to this hotel earlier and had faced delays but not like this. This time, we ended up getting the boxes by 1:30 PM. This is not any exaggeration. Again, the rice was under cooked and there were 5 Payasams. 1 payasam[parippu] was good but for the remaining 3, it was more of same Jaggery water mixed with different boiled things like, ada, wheat etc. and 1 paal payasam was too watery.  When they received the coupon order earlier itself, they should have packed and kept everything ready based on the coupons sold. I am not at all a fan of wasting food, but this was the limit. I really hated the way these guys handled the demand. It was horrible experience especially considering the fact that they were exploiting the demand in the market!!  Issues with Onam Sadhya 2019: - Exorbitantly Expensive - Poor Quality - Poor Management
Had booked food parcel for 15 people on the Thiruvonam day (11th September) . Paid the full amount on the 10th evening and was assured that the food would be ready for collection at 12 pm in time for lunch . Arrived at restaurant at 12 and found a queue of over 200 people waiting . The food parcels were not ready and very few members of staff to deliver the parcels . Had to stand in the queue for over 2.5 hrs to get the Sadya parcel . Unfortunately couldn’t leave and ask for refund as there were limited options to get the meal on Thiruvonam day in trivandrum for 15 people . There was limited communication from the restaurant staff except saying that food would arrive - arrive it did in trickles resulting in severe delays . The restaurant should not have taken orders if it could not deliver . At the very least they could have allocated adequate staff to man the counter and deliver the parcels . I witnessed heated arguments between customers who were frustrated at standing for long hours . Thankfully there were no scuffles although there was a lot of jostling. I was surprised to witness the level of hygiene or rather lack of it . Torn sacks of vegetables were left outside ( often trampled by the customers waiting in the queue) with overflowing bins of waste food accumulating near the delivery counter . Water was seeping through and mixing with the vegetables on the sacks . The quality of the food was very poor - rice was undercooked and the curry’s were at best average . The payasams were below par . I am surprised to see the positive reviews (this is my first experience- and definitely the last ) . If this is an aberration or a one off ( I would be surprised looking at the attitude of the staff and unhygienic environment) then management needs to pull up it socks as in this day and age Customers deserve better !
Food tastes good, is traditional and comes on a banana leave. But they want you to come, eat as fast as possible and go out. Not relaxing. Also to be honest the food is a lot. They love to explain to white people what the health benefits are. Well, they give serveral over-sweetend desserts. Some are liquid and you should drink them out of your hand. But give it a try, it's a good experience and vegetarian.
A very good place for veg food in Thiruvanathapuram. Good varieties of dosas in the evening and tasty breakfast options. Service is a bit slow in the morning and also the tea they serve is not the best. They have year round sadhya meals which is very good. Rest all a good spacious restaurant. Parking could become an issue during rush hours.
Quite ok to eat at the restaurant but over crowded. NEVER order online bcoz they miss out many items and charge much more.......this is definitely intentional as it has happened to me thrice.
Delicious food for reasonable price. Sandhya on all days and very delicious. Main attractive is it's only vegetarian.
Its a must try for guys who visit tvm.fof locals it's just a sadhya we eat on one or any occasion or any hindu wedding ...but non malayalees must try it especially with 4 payasam . This style sadhya you will never get except tvm.go for it rather than taste of money it's the experience.....
Me and my girlfriend visited them and then kept coming back for the next two days. We ordered a Sadhya and some dosas for the first time, not only the food was amazing, but the staff ended us explaining the ingredients and how to correctly eat them. The results was that we ended up overeating not once but several times in the next couple of days!! I highly recommend.
No words ,after a great meal had to crawl out and had wonderful sleep. Felt like an annaconda. Enjoy take sadhya only.
Good place for a properly laid traditional kerala sadya meals. Vegetarian. Served on banana leaves. Well done flavours and spices.. busy and may need to wait in a queue. No reservations. Not a great ambience but fairly priced. Place to experience a nice sadya for nostalgia or to try once if not had one before.
Got feedback from many of my friends who had visited this place when they are in trivandrum and find to be one of the worthy choice, simple and economical. Recommended to those who want to have a vegetarian treat in trivandrum
Visited this restaurant with my family tried 3 varieties of dosa. taste was ok but they are using lot of oil
An authentic place for Kerala vegetarian Lunch, lavish varieties with 4 types of Payasam. Tasting varieties Payasam with Banana, poppadam, Boli makes more tastier. A must place for everyday lunch. for dinner try varieties of mouth watering Dosas. I visit for lunch and dinner everyday during my stay. regards, Sundaresh
Liked this place good vegetarian food is being served here and ambience is also quite well. Sadhya is the speciality.
We reached Mothers Veg Plaza around 04:00 pm for lunch. Kerala Sadhaya was available even at that time and few of us opted for that and rest went for dosa items. The spread for Kerala Sadhya was huge and all dishes were very tasty - especially all of us loved the the fresh mango pickle. The service of waitress Ms. Thanki was unbelievable - she was literally feeding / pampering us as a sister or even a mother would do at home. We haven't seen service of this quality anywhere. She was insisting us to taste all four payasams of which the wheat payasam was really good.  Great restaurant with great service and excellent food.
It was really amazing experience. If any one visit Kerala I personally recommend to visit this place to have Kerala food.
If want to try out original authentic kerala food and you are in Trivandrum then this is the best place to crash in. I never had such super veg items before. I ate like mad, my stomach got full but heart was asking for more.
Just visited the venue and the service is great. The food was the BEST I have eaten in a long time. There were 6 times of chutney and pickle. Kerala and regular rice. 2types of Daal, 4types of veggies, papad, banana, kerala chips, etc etc. Cost 180Rs. For unlimited fresh sumptuous food. Def going to visit again ASAP.
We had gone to the restaurant to have the authentic Kerala Sadya, but unfortunately, it is not served at dinner time. So we tried the 7* uttapam and a plate of variety dosa. The food was tasty and flavorful. The variety dosa plate had about 5 mini dosas. There is a wide and different variety of dosas on the menu like pizza dosa, Mexican dosa, pasta dosa, Chinese dosa.
We had breakfast form here. Ordered special dosa, dry fruit dosa and jini dosa. All were tasty and lot of quantity.
Its the best restaurant in the city you can afford, if you are a veg lover, especially the traditional sadya, mmmmm its yummy ...
Oh dear Gods what is this magical place? Were the first thoughts that came to my mind as I started to try the many selections of dosa we had ordered. I was here with my husband's family who are locals and I proceeded to astound them and myself with the amount of food I consumed. This was hands down the best dosa I have ever had! We finished with pineapple pudding & I went into a food coma. The service was also impeccable. Sorry, I forgot to take pictures of out food before I devoured it but here is our lovely family instead .
No doubt, if you wanted to try a tasty and stupendous Kerala traditional sadhya served on Banana leaf, just visit this place. The quality of food is indeed good, and the service is much superior. They will help you how to try the Sadhya in traditional way. The payasams in the end makes it a perfect climax. When you consider the quality of food and service the cost is too low. This is located again in the heart of the city. Yes, i major precaution you should take before visiting the restaurant is "KINDLY STARVE FOR OVERNIGHT AND GO"
Really good food, enjoyed the meals at noon time. The place is always busy and the owner and staff are very attentive to your needs.
if you are a sadhya monger this is the place to be. you will get traditional kerala sadhyas with aviyal,thoran,olan, kichadies,pickles,paruppu,sambar,rasam butter milk and 4 varrities of payasam ,with boli and bananas .. walk in and relish tummy full of yummy kerala sadhya.
This place is famous, especially, for Sadya. Several delicious items along with different "Payasams" (deserts) makes this traditional dish more awesome! Am a frequent visitor for Sadya and yet not urge to try other items apart from Sadya.
Took my British husband and family to experience true kerala sadya. Very attentive and friendly service. Not posh, normal settings. Fixed price payed at front desk. Good experience.
Had a lot about this place, so wanted to try out. Ordered peas masala and parotta. It was not exceptional, it was just Ok. The ambience was also strictly Ok. They have a good name and the potential is huge, but they need to realise it. Nothing extra ordinary about this. Guess their meals is what attracts customers, but more restaurants are going to do the same.
Went in last Sunday. As usual the place was crowded. Waited for 10 minutes and finally someone came to get us seated, but he disappeared after that. Then after 15 mins got seated. We had to find the seat. Seating is very average. Low cost chair and tables. Typical vegetarian foods like dosa, chapati, etc. There are different varieties of dosas. We ordered jini dosa. It's great. It costs RS 130 though. Also ordered masala dosa as parcel. We also ordered Apple and papaya shake but I did not like it. Hotel management has to take care off customers. It looks like it's minimum investment maximum gain. They really don't care if we don't get a place to sit. Saw a family coming in after us and left after seeing no space. A little bit of customer service will have a lasting affect. Will not be visiting here again.
Actually we did not visit the place but ordered SADAY meals through under eats. The parcel ( a box) contained about 25 dishes in all with a plantain leaf as plate. The quality and taste are ok. Each meal priced Rs250/-.
Lovely and nice , many options on the menu, if you want to have the banana leaf experience then be there by 4 because its finished by that time
More hype than substance. Visited for breakfast today. No proper menu only word by mouth. Ordered puttu but cancelled due to non availability of accompanied dish. Ordered masala dosa ordinary.
We had traditional Kerala sadya from this restaurant. Great food including wide range of payasam. Quite reasonable pricing. The portions get refilled up on request.  It gets quite busy during lunch time, so if you are looking to get there at peak lunch hours, you would probably might have to be on a queue.  Also there are not many parking lots, but the guard outside was doing a great job to get the cars in and out.  Overall: Very satisfied !!
Lovely malyalee banana leaf rice. Had the sadya feast. Strange to eat payasam on the banana leaf but I guess that’s how it’s done here.
This one of vegetarian hotel near fly over junction -delicious tiffin meals will be served which ilke
Food tasted really great. We ordered A la carte from the available options. Must say Paneer Butter Masala was very good. Chapatis were served hot. Only downside, you must wait patiently for 10-15 min after ordering.
The place is really crowded during the lunch time. But it is worth the wait. The sadya (feast) is very tasty and rich with several curries.
Very good restaurant... went for lunch... kerala sadya was super... with four payasams.. staff are very good.. good service..they also have various varieties of dosa..
Authentic Kerela meals...explains why the place was so crowded...avoid visiting on Weekends or holidays. Service automatically goes down....a week day will give you a better experience
Their Kerala style veg feasts for lunch are the best bets. Available in two categories - normal meals and feasts - the meals to stick to the Trivandrum tradition and generally tasty. The feast, priced around Rs. 188 per person, is heavy with four types of payasams and can induce sleep in the next two hours.  During evenings, Jini Dosa is their best pick. It's a kind of Masla Dosa with Chinese Style Masala. They offer other kinds of typical vegetarian cuisine as well
My husband and I had lunch here as recommended by our driver. We ordered the sandhya. It was amazing!!! I have never experience this type of meal before but what we think was the owner /manager explained to us step by step. I can not thank you enough for your kind hospitality. We left feeling very full but very satisfied. A complete meal and no gas or bloating afterward. This restaraunt is a must stop for any foodies worldwide. I will also be writing about our experience to lonely planet and hopefully they will feature this place in their next edition.
The restaurant is usually crowded during lunch time. The spread is the best available in town with all possible varieties of curries, pickles, parippu (dal) sambar, rasam, pulisseri, moru and payasam. Takeways are available in pre-packed boxes. You can also try three to four varieties of payasam in half and one litre packs.
If you really want to taste good home made sadhya, you have got to visit Mothers Veg plaza. This is my forth year having tasty, lip smacking paysam. If you are a first timer, please be ready for multiple rounds of yummy food. You get regular meals and you get sadhya, please ask for Sadhya (not that meals is any lesser). A must go to place in Trivandrum. Oh BTW , you get Sadhya only in the afternoon, the restaurant transforms into this very creative place in the evening serving multitude varieties of Dosa.
A must visit place for all food lovers. Their vegetarian lunch is very popular and rightly so. At 180 Rs per head we get to experience the magic of Kerala vegetarian cuisine with unlimited portions. Truly a vegetarian food lover’s paradise.
Very good service. Feels like family. Waiting time less. പായസം super. Repeated serving is there. Onam meals 365 days a year. Very busy place. You can buy parcels also
Awesome food and service. Liked the part that someone goes around explaining about the food n how it is to be eaten in terms of it being authentic Kerala veg Sadya.

On our way to a temple shrine in Kerala ,we had reached Trivandrum and wanted to have simple veg food .A friend of ours recommended this place , we were a group of 7 people .not very keen on food but were particular about it being pure vegetarian, We reached the place and it was jam packed on a Sunday afternoon , we had to wait for 15 mins and we got the place and this was one of the best foody experience for me. First of all in-spite of so much rush ,the crowd management and the staff were very adept in there jobs. There was never a sense of urgency in service, making it a delightful experience of having lunch there. Special mention has to be made of Mr Sanal Kumar who was explaining the details of each and every part of traditional kerala sadya ,that we were having. Each and every food item was very good , but special mention has to be made of the four types of Payasams ,made of jaggery ,beetroot ,vermicelli and dal that was also too good. We were also gently reminded not to waste any food , and the food itself was so good that though our stomachs were filled , but heart did not want to stop. All good things have to come to an end ,and what a way to end it with a banana, very nice.
A lot of variety of Vegetarian food available and especially Kerala specialties are excellent Lunch is the best part
This is a place visitors can enjoy the ONA SADHYA during 365 days. All items are very tasty. They will serve you unlimited food in Benana Leaves only. One should book the entry in advance by net or to reach the place little early as there will be a minimum crowd for lunch and dinner time.
Awesome food. We are North Indian staying at Andhra Pradesh so we love meals and here we find very good meals but we thought in Trivandrum Kerala we thought food might not be so tasty as in Andhra but our prediction was wrong it was equally tasty and would love to visit again n again
Yesterday due to a major oversight I realized minutes before guests (50 numbers)were arriving for a sadya meal that the venue of the occasion had not arranged any catering. We frantically called many food outlets. At 11.45 AM me and my brother reached Mothers Plaza hoping something could be done. To our great relief not only could they immediately pack and mobilize service staff with the food the manager himself drove the van to our venue as a driver was not available. The guests stared arriving by 12.30 and Mothers Plaza has the meals laid out by 1PM as planned. The food was excellent and the crisis was over thanks to Mothers Plaza. No other organization in the city as we tried could take this challenge to rescue us. A great embarrassment saved thanks to Mothers Plaza.
I gave treat to my brother, from another state. He was having sadhya for the first time and he loved it. I was also happy to give him the right food treat
The place was overflowing with people. It seems to be very popular for an elaborate Kerala Sadhya on banana leaf.  Chaotic yet systematic. The turn over of people eating here is huge. There's a steady stream of people coming in and going out.  The owner of the restaurant is also seen making rounds and interacting with customers.  The number of dishes served is the USP of this restaurant.  But somewhere along the line the taste has been compromised. Aviyal lacked flavour, puli inji was dismal, rasam...less said the better.  Four types of payasams...too sweet and no distinct flavours came through. All ended tasting similar.  What put me off was the waiter placing the serving dish on top of used/ eaten banana leaf, while serving us. Speaks of lack of training.  Having so many items doesn't make up for lack of flavour in the food.
Me and my friends went here just to take a look at the place try the food and it was really good and tasty and the service there was also very good but it was very crowded its because of their taste food
The one point which i want to convey to the management of mother's veg plaza is to train the lady who is sitting as a cashier to smile at the costomer.If i am looking at her it seems to be like i am having food with her money.  The graetest part all other staffs are amazing .They are really costomer friendly.There is an uncle who is wearing a spects ,a lady who is always wearing a green t shirt they are amazing.A part from the first thing i am very happy to dine at mothers veg plaza.
Our driver recommended this place as an authentic local place. We had the Sadhya and a Jini Dosa. We asked for the Sadhya on plates instead of the banana leaf, as the banana leaf was wet with water and as foreign tourists this would have been risky. The Sadhya was spicy but a good experience as you got to try lots of different things. The Jini Dosa was also quite tasty. Cheap and a cool experience. Don't expect much of an ambience but the service was very attentive for us.
Most of us North Indians imagine all South Indian food to comprise of Dosa, Idli, Sambhar and medu vada. I was no different till the time i visited Kerala. Its not that i hadn't been to Southern states, i was familiar with Chennai, Bangaluru, Mysore, but i had never ventured this lose to the tropic of Cancer. So like a typical North Indian, i had Dosa for breakfast and then went looking for Dosa again for lunch. After people gave me quizzical looks, i realised that i was going drastically wrong and did some research (just a fancy way of saying i asked my driver). I came to know that 'Sadhya' is something i should try and it is that assortment of dishes on a Banana leaf that one sees on TV.  So, i landed up in this restaurant and my god what a find it was. The place was teeming with customers, forget getting your own table and please leave your convent educated eating habits at the door. This place is as authentic as it gets. So get ready to share your table with strangers, eat with your fingers and on a lovely Banana leaf.  The rates are absurdly reasonable at jusr Rs 170 a plate. The meal consisted of 4 kinds of Dals (lentil stew), 5 kinds of vegetables, an assortment of rice, papad, curd and 4 types of sweet dishes. There is an elderly gentleman, perhaps the owner who goes around coaxing people to eat more and explains how to combine the various delicacies to us bewildered looking toyrists. The meal is a sumptuous treat, with smiling serving staff and clean settings. It was a memorable experience, what with struggling to eat with fingers and discovering exotic eats.  I would strongly recommend this restaurant to all those looking for a genuine Kerala gastric treat.
Traditional kerala style sadya (a meal served on plantain leaves) served on all days at lunch time. Varieties of payasam will be served. If you are non malayali on visit to Trivandrum , you can visit the place to have a taste of traditional kerala meal. Please remember the place will be crowded at lunch time, so have patience .
One of the best vegetarian restaurant in Trivandrum. Kerala style sadya is awesome and is available here 365 days. Unique tasty dosa varieties here give a great feasts to tastebuds.
Our Uber driver recommended this place when we asked for a typical Kerala meal and we are thankful to him for the suggestion. Really great food. I think we found nine courses. Started with paruppu kolumbu and sambar followed by FOUR different kinds of rasam. Then came the curd curry (not sure of the official name), rasam and buttermilk courses. The wait staff were very efficient. We are not fans of vegetarian food but this place changed our minds. A must visit place in TRV.
Nothing great here, 3 kichadi, 1 thoran 1 avial, parippu, sambar,rasam, pulusery, 2 pickles, Ada, semia and kadala payasam . Cost 180 plus tax, junior manikantan in East fort gives excellent food RS.100.. nothing great here..
You can experience authentic kerala sadhya throughout the year. I have visited her a couple of times.
If you are in Thiruvananthapuram you need to go to Mothers Veg Plaza. Good location and amazing traditional food:)
Located in heart of city . Our guide Daniel took us to this restaurant which serves authentic south indian thali with reasonable prices . Staff is one of the best which I have seen till date . Very cooperative . They taught us the right method to eat the ingredients of this traditional meal . Taste was awesome too . Must must visit place for all foodies
While in Kerala for my wife's Ayervedic treatment, her doctor had recommended "Mother's Kitchen" as the place to go for Vegetarian cuisine. We tried to go there on one occasion but found it was closed, so luckily a few days later we had managed to visit while it was open. Presented with a menu we were taken by the vast selection of dishes, for Dosa's there are about 30-40 different types. As we normally try the signature dish wherever we go, we elected to get the Kerala Thali or Sadya in this case. Our attentive waitress bought out firstly a large banana leaf for our plate or service area. This was then followed by a selection of pickles (4) sauces and rice. It is almost like an Indian degustation as we were given a selection of curries to match the rice. then to finish with 4 x different deserts, with banana, uppadum and rice. Highly recommended as a place to visit if in Trivandrum, Kerala.
we visited here twice and both times its been a lovely experience, there are variety of dosas, which all are good and tasty, but their sadya meal is really something which should not be missed if you are in Trivandrum. beside food the staff is so good and make sure you get every single item of the meal. I bet you will definitely be over eaten at the end as the food is so delicious that you might find it difficult to stop. Will surely visit again and again whenever in Trivandrum.
The local Rickshawalas are not familiar with its name, so you need to mention its location as Near Bakery Junction. I had tried their sadya during my last visit to Trivandrum in July 2018. The lingering taste made me return a second time. Being single I did not have much difficulty in sharing a seat alongside a Russian couple on a four chair dining table, though it was a Sunday and the restaurant was crowded but not half as crowded by Mumbai standards. They also serve a variety of dosas and my neighbors at the table, were savoring one against my recommendation of Sadya which they said would be too heavy for them. I always consider a wholesome meal, a litmus test for any restaurant, so I order it wherever available. Sadya is a full course meal served on festive occasions like Onam, but here they serve it all year around. The pure vegetarian restaurant probably has a Christian Proprietor Mr Sanal , but in a linguistically secular Kerala it really doesn’t matter and you find a hungry diaspora of food lovers here. Mr Sanal is a good marketer and is present at the table of perceived new visitors to give subtle tips and information that add to your culinary experience The food marathon starts the moment you place your prepaid coupon for Rs 180 (Pretty reasonable for an unlimited meal) on the table, A full size plantain leaf is laid out followed by Heap of brown rice with dal, sambar, puliseri, Rasam , Variety of pickles including the Puli inji, Papadam ,a plethora of side vegetables not to mention the traditional Avial ,Thoran, a banana, 3 types of Payasams of the day. The staff is prompt in ensuring that the sequence in the marathon is relayed and you do not miss even a single item on the Sadya menu…. And you leave the restaurant with a satisfied Burp. Will never miss whenever in Trivandrum.
We had traditional kerala sadya from the restaurant. It was not only delicious but homely too. A must visit place
This is a good place for traditional kerala meals. The only bad thing about this place is that sometimes the restaurant team over explain things and make it slightly boring...Especially when we visit the place with international guests
Very bad quality sadhya. Worst and waste selection ever in our opinion. U have to maintain the quality of food
You might find the place a bit crowded during lunch hours but it makes up for the special Kerala lunch they serve. It’s called Sadya and comes with all the local vegetarian flavours. The different varieties of payasam ( sweet porridge ) they serve are also excellent . It’s better if you ask the management on how to eat the special Kerala lunch meal ( sadya ). The staff is very helpful. The place is kept averagely clean and neat. It’s a must try restaurant for vegans and vegetarians.
we have been travelling quite a while now in india and this place was by far the best choice ever. yesterday evening, we had some manchurian and aloo gobi. this afternoon, we had the SADHYA experience. Sadhya is a all you can eat food, served with rise and various curries on a banana leaf. it costed 180 rupee per head and we had the chance to eat some authetic food. The waitressess were extremely attentive and helped us throughout the journey :) e.g. how to properly eat the food... go and have a bite there, it is not expensive for foreigners. when i say not expensive, i always look to the price of biryani. if it is lower than 100 rupee; it is not a rip off. to check it out. hope you all enjoy like we enjoyed :)
Good restaurant and great food. Worth for money . Management need to come up with a better system to manage people coming to eat. You have to stand behind each table to grab a seat which is not actually polite but you have no other choice.
The ultimate stop for a hearty Kerala Sadya (traditional Kerala vegetarian meals served on banana leaves with 4-5 varieties of kheer/payasam for dessert) Therefore, there is a rush between 12-2 pm. Ample quantities of rice and tasty curries are served. The payasams are yummy, though served in small portions (perhaps because they serve 4-5 varietes.Traditional "boli" (sweet made with gram flour) and plaintains are served along with the payasams (in Kerala Sadya, payasams are devoured in traditional combinations like boli-vermicelli kheer, plaintain-rice flakes kheer, pappad-jaggery kheer etc).
Not at all impressed with the restaurant, staff or meals. Very bland tasteless meals. waste of time n effort..so sorry
Dear friends, Today I had a lunch(sadhya meals) from mothers veg plaza.I expected a lot about their sadhya meals after going through the reviews found here.But all my expectations was in vain.Almost all the curry items serving in a sadhya was there, but the taste did not resembled a sadhya.It was not worthy for rs 189, ordinary meals (@80/100 rs) from other veg hotels would serve better.If you are there just expecting a veg meals it's ok, but very much expectations about sadhya meals will left you in despair.
"Sadya" is excellent. Cleanliness has gone down and the place becomes overcrowded by 1:30 pm. Parking is also a problem. Some parking restrictions in the main road. If you wanna enjoy the food....be there atleast by 12:15.
the worst masala dosas in town.the only incridient was onion.the service was the worst too.prices was exorbitant.
Very tasty and authentic food. I have a suggestion that the service could have been a bit better, to enjoy the food.
One of the best full course lunch served here. Very authentic kerala dishes served with lot of care and attention.. waiting staff smartly notices what one likes and generously serve additional helpings..
I had tasted Dosas from there. It was tasty and hot. I also heard that their afternoon feast (Sadya) is good. I will try it I'm future and update.
Very good food , tastey and clean . Large number of curries and got around 4 types of payasam ,it's exact replica of a grant malayala Sandhya .
Excellent food but cannot enjoy as people are waiting behind u for seats Sadhya is the speciality Not a cozy place
As reference from my friends myself along with Family had lunch from this place, food was ok not up to Arya's or Ashokbhavan in Kochi, but not bad too, if you look in to rate part it's bit expensive for the taste of food they offered.overall you can rate 6:10
...or so they claim. They have a dosa with any and every type of filling. We tried a few and it was a good change, but some of the fillings especially for slow moving items may not be too fresh. I would still stick to plain butter dosa or masala dosa. They offered only dosa, and not the traditional Sadhya at the time we went (dinner). However, this place was a good change with quick service and not too expensive, although not too plush.
We went there looking for some good authentic dosas, after reading great reviews. The ambience is ok, ample seating, service was also quick but sadly the dosas were far from being authentic in taste. There was ample variety, like noodles dosa, ginie dosa and so on. We didn't like it one bit, nor were the chutney and sambhar any great in taste. The payasams too were just average and the coffee was just ok. Go there if you want to try something new but you will be disappointed if you go there looking for some authentic fare.
Dozens of kinds of 'Dosa' and many curries to choose from. It is a very local eatery, cheap prices (for Westerners). Dinner for 4, having ordered 2 dishes too many, just to taste, came at under $20. Service was nothing special until after we placed our order of too much food and became the attraction of the restaurant. The food was authentic and delicious.
I like this place good vegetarian food is being served here and ambiance is also quite well beautiful service also
Went there to eat food. Had to wait there for a lot of time.. none cared . Had to talk to the cashier why none were coming to take the order. Had to wait even further 20 mins after that for one to come and take orders.. if you are starving and looking for a veg hotel  This is definitely not the place
I have been to this place 2 times.. first for lunch.. which was just okay with that price tag! There was nothing extra ordinary. (Maybe because I am from North Kerala, and trivandrum style of cooking doesnt suite my taste buds) I went again for breakfast another time, and was again disappointed. Cold food (at 9am) and definitely had nothing that would make it stand out.
It's just another average vegetarian restaurant but with above average service customer service. Their menu is vast the food is just average. It's not bad but not up to the hype for sure.
Delicious food at great prices. The oppuma was out of this world.best I’ve tasted anywhere in the world.
My god this meal was absolutely incredible. For 180 rupees the value you get is incredible. They would keep topping up the banana leaf. There was this pineapple curry that was DIVINE. And the desserts were so dam tasty as well (there were 4 different kinds.) Incredible. And wish I had the appetite to go there again!
No words to describe 100 times of awesome Veg.Thali / Vazhayila Sadhya is really awesome the owner himself describe to the customers how to have the sadhya and personally attend all the tables even serves the dessert and explain how to have it...loved it will suggest and will visit again and again until I get the same experience
Their Kerala sadhya ( traditional food served on banana plant leaves) is value for money and tasty. You can order food via phone for home delivery. They have more than 50/100 variety of disaster ( indian pancake). My son loves their pizza dosa.
We were 4 families on a 3 day trivandrum trip for the dasara holidays. Being vegetarian, we had shortlisted a few restaurants for having our food. After having the Sadya meal, we were completely impressed. Amazing taste, good variety of food. We came back for trying their Various doors and were impressed again.  Even the different lime juices they offer is really good.  The place gets bit crowded and rightly so. At times, service can be bit slow but worth the wait.  I would definitely come back here, and recommend this restaurant for vegetarians visiting Teivandrum.
Good food and good service! Might be crowded most of times and will have to wait to get seats. But the food is worth the wait!
Crowded ambience. Good if you can just concentrate on the food. Service was quick and efficient. The special sadya was very good and comes with 4 payasams - ada, kadala, beetroot and semiya with boli. The Kadala payasam was excellent; the betroot tasted less like payasam and more like a new kind of sweet dish. The other two payasams were good. Overall, value for money.
If you would like to taste and experience traditional/local Kerala 'sadhya' or feast, this is a great option in Trivandrum. Prices are quite reasonable. For those who are not aware, 'sadhya' includes only vegetarian food. This can be literally a filling experience.  Useful to keep in mind though that the place can get quite crowded, seats can be difficult to find, especially during lunch hours and the overall experience can become uncomfortable if you're not used to crowds. This is a destination to bring visiting friends to experience Kerala sadhya. There's a process to the servings and staff are happy to explain, sometimes insist on following the flow. One can of course be selective. For visiting folks, it's useful to note that some dishes can be spicy - so, better to ask or do a quick taste before going further.
Nandhu, our tour driver from The Travel Planners, bought us here to experience Keralian Thali, a wonderful  The owner was gracious with his time explaining the various dishes. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish presented & mixing with the various accompiants. A highlight of our 4 week Indian Holiday
Very good.We bought lunch for15 people. Sadya. It was very fantastic.People never experienced such taste from a hotel food. It was homely food. They thought that we made it in our home. You will get sadya 365 days from Mothers Plaza. They served the food at our home in packets we supplied it in our pots and in plantain leaf they supplied. Considerably it was cheap. I
Provides excellent typical Kerala Sadya. The preparations are done using coconut oil. Those who do not like the taste of coconut oil should avoid this place. Usually one has to wait for his/her turn to get a seat. It attracts a huge crowd during lunch.
Missed Onam celebration and feast. Enjoy true ona Sadhya every day at Mothers kitchen. Simply awesome
This place serves some amazing sadhya - full.meals. They have 16 different types of side dishes in addition to rice sambhar rasam buttermilk and 4 different types of paayasam.
A very nice place for a vegetarian food, this was very close to HILTON and MG ROAD, they server great appam and even the NORTH indian food was great
We went on the day of Onam. Many people were already there waiting for seat, so we had to wait for one hour to get seat. The food was very good and tasty. First time, I had 6 types of payasams.
We ordered Onam sadya for 15 people and on the day of collection it was. a total chaos and mayhem. No responsible person from the management were there and food was not ready.Big queues and waited for 2 hours and still no food. Never again. Atlast got the box and when opened at home most items were NOT there and they cheated on us and took their money.
What a way they have to treat people knowing they are north Indian, Superb! We didn't know about much of the variety and procedure of having lunch at the banana leaf. We were a group and enjoyed our meals with sequence and enjoyed a lot. The team here is happy to offer you what you want but on the sequence only. I was insisting to have Kadi but they refused as I didn't complete my early course.  Good staff and nice food, they introduced us to the Kerala food in detail.
Looking for a place to have the most delicious sadhya? No thinking twice. This place offers the best. They have variety of dishes and variety payasams as well. They have different varieties of dosa too. I would recommend families who visit from abroad to try this place to taste the authentic food of Kerala!!
Ordered onam sadya for 10 people.Was amazing .Homely taste with enough food to serve five more people.Prompt delivery and superbly packed.
The Kerala lunch served everyday is the speciality. Ideal if you have a guest from out of Town/state who wishes to know about the typical Malayali veg lunch. The items are tasty but not the very best. Could be very crowded in peak lunch times No table reservation possible. Service is tolerable but could be better. Not ideal for a leisurely lunch. Great for a quick lunch break.Prices are reasonable
We had lunch in Mother’s Veg Plaza. It’s a purely Kerala Veg lunch with variety of side items & Payasam (sweet) served with lunch. They have variety of Dosas, Iddily & Vada and many other veg foods too. Any one wants to have an authentic Kerala Veg. Food they shouldn’t miss this place.
Excellent Kerala Sadhya served in the traditional manner. Very tasty and worth the money. Need to expertise in capacity management.
They have a large variety of Dosas, which is their speciality. The satff are attentive and place is neat and well maintained.
Horrible experience from Mothers Veg Plaza Trivandrum..The arrogance from the owner was terrible. Now to the events..Since there was no Onam celebration this time, we decided we are no making the sadya at home but instead we placed an order with Mothers Veg Plaza with a delivery to home guaranteed on 25th August 2018. Guess what, they did not deliver, never bothered attending our calls and left us in despair. I went there asked the manager what went wrong, I even told him it would have been OK provided they informed us a delivery could not be made. I wanted to speak with the owner and yes I did. Trust me, I was taken aback by his attitude..He said 'Onam aakumbol tharaan pattiyilla ennokke varum, aa refund koduthu vidade'. Which translates to 'its Onam and we may not deliver, just get this guy his refund'.This is exactly what he told me and that's the only reason I am making a post here. I don't think the customers should be taken for granted like this. And I am not complaining about the quality of the food which we never had..But please beware when you order for home delivery from here, take precautions and keep alternate arrangements in place. To think about it, we had placed the order a few days ago itself..And they had enough time to let us know, which they never did..
Nice family restaurant You can have 100 types of dosas And onam food through out the year Staff was very cordial only issue is language
It was not a planned trip to trivandrum ,happened to visit this city due to flight cancellation...came accross this place through trip advisor...the staff was over welcoming ...served food with gr8 love with all the discription of each n every dish with their traditional origin n health benefits....throughly enjoyed the meal...dint feel tht i was having sadhya at a restaurant.....highly recommended by me!! Ps:(all the 4 payasams were juz tooo amazing)
I was recommended to visit this restaurant and I loved their delicious vegetarian food, very friendly staff and value for money. Can highly recommend this restaurant.
Very good service and Excellent food. Try to reach there before 1 PM to get seats ,rush hour from 1 PM to 2.30 PM
It was amazing experience at Mothers restaurant the variety on offer was quite amazing and unique taste. A truly Vegetarian's delight. The additional plus is varieties of dosas which are available. Very good quality and cleanliness. A must try for all.
I am a North Indian living in Delhi. Because of the family's love for dosa, we frequent Delhi cafes. But the Sadhya me and my wife had at this place was by far the best meal of my life. We reached there around 315 and the place was almost empty. I was apprehensive of eating by hand but damn, once I ate I just couldn't stop. The staff felt amused looking at my face: true foodgasm. There was an uncle also who guidede me through the meal, couldn't find him later to thank for his help. And the bill for two was lesser that what you pay for your coffee at CCDs etc.  Don't think, go there. In fact, please ensure if you are passing by Trivandrum ( I love calling cities by their old names), this is one highlight you can't afford to miss.  Happy eating.
Visited this place for a weekday lunch. It was bustling with people. There is plenty of seats and the ambience is decent. But what is amazing is the service, impeccable.  We ordered the meal, 3 course? 4 course? 5 course? 7 course? There was no stopping, a new item every time till we were full to the brim. The owner ensured to teach us the correct way to consume the dishes and also explained the benefits. The food was delicious. The sweets even more.  Special mention for the medicated water.  Would definitely recommend this place, do not miss it!
Been there for breakfast dosas were really nice even they have a very good selection of dosas in the menu apart from that other breakfast dishes like upma anicend poori were also
Good Sadya 365 dyas. Parcel well packed and arranged. Good Tasty food. Lots of dishes and options available. Usually crowded during lunch hours, better to take parcel. Neatly packed
A clean restaurant that offers a nice kerala style sadya in plaintain leaf which lots of sides and kerala desert.
thali meals are there best...especially onam sadhya are to be booked in advance to have 3 paysams on banana leaf,,too crowded during onam season
I had a pleasant experience eating here, the food is good and cheap, and one of the waiters took his time to guide me in what should be eaten together, and in which order.
I had the most amazing traditional Kerela food combined with great hospitality and courtesy by the staff..... The gentleman there even took pains of teaching me how to eat the meal in the right order.... highly impressed .....its a must visit when in Thiruvananthapuram
We had gone to mothers plaza for a good kerala meals during lunch time. The place was full and we had to wait. The traditional kerala meals served was nice with lots of side dishes. Recommended for vegetarian South Indian thali meals.
Though we went here too late for lunch, it was almost 4 p.m. They were still serving lunch. We ordered kerala lunch thali and fresh banana leaf was spread in front of us. So many varieties of chutney, sabzi, pickles, banana chips sweet and salty both were served. Just tasting all these our stomach was full. Then the owner came to us he explained the ayurvedic significance of the meal to us, also told us the sequence and combination of different food served to us. He then personally served us sweets, also telling us the correct combination what to eat with what. Such a thoughtful gesture. Hope to visit it again this time by 1p.m. and absolutely empty stomach.
Me and my friends went to mothers veg for a lunch the food was excellent and one portion will be enough for one person but the service is not good because when we gone to the table no one attend us we have to wait for 15 mins if its busy period we'll understand but there was not much crowd and we have to call the service staff anyway plz improve u r service standards
This is the best place for get good food.And the have variety taste of items.we are so happy on there...
Went for authentic South Indian breakfast experience but found the items too oily and same as any other South Indian joint. Nothing special.
Get and Feel the Best vegetarian food in Trivandrum city.Parking facility available .Good FEast are avaialble here for good rate and also tasty food.VEg Tali here is around the town.
Its a great idea to serve and have feast everyday. Mothers plaza just fulfils that idea. Traditional kerala feast (Ona sadya) is being served on plantain leaves. Food is good. But the heavy rush during peak times keep you wait for long time to get an additional curry serving. A prospective visitor must be ready to wait...
Excellent food, service & hygienic . Staff very friendly. The food was delicious & lot of items. Overall it was excellent.
Had tasty veg food with good atmosphere & good hygiene, Recommend to other travelers if looking for good veg restaurant in Trivandrum.
Been here with family for lunch this week during our trip to Trivandrum. This place offers the lunch that I have been missing for years.
Kerala Sadya in plantain leaf. Tasty Kerala meals which is truly homely served neatly. Professional service. The restaurant will be a bit crowded during peak lunch time.Neverthless this is the best vegetarian restaurant in Thiruvanthapuram
Had eaten here once before - about five months ago - and liked it as much now as I did then. Very good food, although somewhere in there there was ONE thing that was too spicy for a non Indian. Have to find out what that was next time.
Located in the heart of the city , the restaurant is apparently new with a local veg restaurant appearance. It has a local crowd and a pretty nice option for veg food. The place is spacious and has a lot of tables. They have a open dosa counter too where they cook live dosa infront of us ..Good option for a veg meal for lunch or a dosa for dinner
This is good option for Vegetarian food..not too costly ..they serve food on banana leaf.. varieties of dosas and rice and that too not very spicy.
We were looking for a veg restaurant that service typical Keral meals on a banana leaf, we were asked to try this place by our taxi driver. The service is real good, true to its name. Food is really tasty, we even tried boiled rice with sambar what a combination...if you are a sweet lover, they do serve four different payasams..
✓ Best hotel to provide 100 variety of dosa. ✓ Clean and tidy. ✓ Staffs are friendly. ✓ Provide good sadhya.
A vegetarian restaurant serving ‘Sadhya’ all throughout the year ! I have been to Mothers Plaza 4-5 times only for their Sadya during lunch time. Whenever I feel like having a sadya I rush to Mother's Plaza. It never disappoints me. They serve 3 different payasams .Its better to reach by 12 pm as the restaurant has space constraints. During peak time , we need to wait for 10-15 minutes to get a slot.
I had higher expectations of Mothers Veg Plaza from all the buzz around it - quite a few recommendations from locals at the hotel, etc. Maybe I should have tried the famous Sadhya meal in the afternoon? We visited one evening and the food was bang average. I tried a recommended dosa called 'Gini' dosa which was overly spicy. My wife ordered chhole bhature and the chhole looked like some leftovers - we promptly returned that dish. The paper dosa was good though.
Sadya, a kerala thali normally prepared in special occasions like marriage, birthday etc. It is a pure veg meal with more than 20 items including 4 to 6 sweet items. So this is a high calory food and likely to have hangover after eating. You take to take rest for at least 4 hours after taking this meal. Or restrict intake. Not costly. Supplied in big banana leaf. spicy, salty but not oily. Once in a while ok.
The side dishes served on the banana leaves are more than 16 in numbers. All are very tasty and traditional. The cost per lunch is Rs.180/- But it is worthy. Very easily digested and natural taste as cooked and served by "MOTHER".
The food is amazing. There are so many options available to choose. The staff is very polite and the service is very fast. But you might have to wait for some time to get a table.
A great bustling place filled with families enjoying Friday night together. The food was good, the service was fast(ish) and friendly, and we'd recommend this for a great local pit stop!
Are you in Trivandrum now? Looking for a traditional Kerala sadya(vegetarian lunch served in banana leaves)? Grab a cab/auto and ask the driver to drop you at Mothers Veg plazza. Expect rush during peak time. You will get the sadya through out the year. They also serve various types of dosas. Restaurant is clean and staff are friendly. Rates are a bit high, but considering the quality of the food, its reasonable.
Very traditional and taste of food was awesome over all. Service is beyond imaginable for any one to experience, one should not miss this when some one travel to Trivendrum. Management of this restaurant are very focused for customer statisfaction.
Restaurant is in a good locality, transportation is not a problem, its clean and food is ok. The staff should be more courteous. Their attention to customers is bit week or ignorant. I visited 4 to 5 times, delay in taking order and difficult to get service to order more. Food quantity should be little more. Also need more arrangement in parking. The person who assigned to assist parking should be more vigilant.  I give 4 star for location, clean and food.
I had a craving to eat kerala sadya which once a year feast during onam.Mothers veg plaza is a saviour to those who miss those sadya. With around 16 kootu currys( side dishes), the sadya served at mothers veg plaza is a sumptious lunch for Rs. 200 per person.Due to the high demand, the place is highly crowded, but the service is very fast.(Please note that the sadya is only available as lunch)  Sadya includes - Kerala rice/ White rice (optional) , Parippu curry (kerala dal curry) . Sambar , 3 courses of payasam( sweet porridge/ kheer) , rasam, buttermilk , pulisserry (kerala style dahi with all tadkas) + 16 different types of side dishes.  Well...to comment on the other dishes served at mothers plaza for breakfast and dinner, im not satisfied at all.It can be rated as only fair/average.  I would only recommend the sadya from this restaurant.
For a non-southindian, you need a guide book or a locale to take you through this journey of taste paradise. Unending serving of chutneys, veggies and curries with unlimited rice is just too much to handle. starting from papadam and banana chips to three varieties of payasama, they serve you just unimaginable variety of foods. Different people will have different taste buds, here you are guaranteed to find something to appease your buds.
Variety dosas, quality veg foods as well as good ambience. Price is is reasonable, if you are out with your friends and family for veg foods, then this is the place
I had visited this place with family and also ordered some 20 Sadhya for a function at home. The quality is good with decent quantity and economical priced. The restaurant ambience and service isn’t so great but good for outdoor catering.
One place in Trivandrum where you get decent varieties .They have ample varieties of dosa which is a real treat .I guess this is one of the oldest restaurant near Trivandrum central .Off late I felt its bit over rated though highly recommended
One of the best vegetarian lunch served in trivandrum .Not many know about this resturant .Sadhya which is served for lunch is their speciality . it is a must visit for having some good kerala vegetarian meals
We had reached Kerala after almost an year and we were longing for a traditional lunch. All our friends recommended this restaurant and it turned out to be one of the best lunches we ever had. There are so many varieties to taste. Finally 4 different Payasams.
This restaurant is a must visit for having the experience of eating "Sadhya" which is only served for lunch. This dish consists of lot of variety of items which satisfy your taste buds completely and in one meal give you to tour of Kerala. Also the restaurant serves multiple variety of dosa's which are yummy. Dosa's are served for dinner. Service is an issue but due to the awesome food it is worth the trouble. A mandatory visit when in the city.
Yesterday we visited veg plaza,we saw the owner of the hotel who working as a staff,we got Excellent foods, but very bad service and rude staffs
We visited to have kerala style food...first of all they give various chutney and very less vegetables/curry options...on the top of it they give food as per their wishes in their so called thali system...i didnt liked the sweets offered and thus told them thrice to give me few rice and moong dal...despite that they didnt gave me that and forced me to eat their sweets as they say it is how they eat...what nonsense if somebody is not liking some items of the thali system and requesting sone other items which were supposed to be unlimited as per them...they dont give...worst experience ever
We visited this place before we fly from Trivandrum. They serve variety of dishes including Sadhya- A traditional Kerala meal. The meal is served on big banana leaf.They serve 5-6 types of Chutneys , two types of Rice. 4 types of Payasam( sweets) , one special sweet made of banana. Sambhar , aloo subzi , papad , warm water and ... cant remember all.. Even you might have tasted Kerala meal in your tour.. have this meal to cherish your taste bud.
You should definitely go for typical Kerala thali if you are on Kerala tour. All food is good but thali is superb. You will die eating so many dishes on banana leaf. Food taste is excellent. Sweet dishes are out of the world. Staff service is superb and all are wearing smile on the face. They make you eat like you are in home. Highly recommended.
Based on previous good reviews, we visited the restaurant; we were not disappointed. The food was very good with a lot of selection. The many innovative ‘Dosa’ combinations were interesting. Some of them were excellent but others, while innovative, would be a misnomer as dosa. The sweet and sour soup was excellent(a bit too spicy but very tasty and filling) The porotta and poor I were excellent. The service was excellent; very polite, timely and efficient service. Overall very satisfied with the experience and plan to visit again
Though heard of this place popular for Sadya round the year, I randomly visited the place during evening tea time. The menu gives you a range of variety dosas. I tried the butter masala dosa and loved it.
Very tasty and delicious veg food items are available here. The taste is very good and tasty restaurants.
Lot of north indians and tourist people,only a few trivandrum people, serving rice and other Curry's only a little bit for an amount Rs of 126.only one payasam.Other nearby veg hotels charging less and good quantity of food,But not sadhya.overcrowded with tourists.cleaniess ok.Visiting one time ok.
This is the Indian equivalent to McDonald’s for Kerala thali meals, A great place, when you arrive you are rushed to a table and then the number of people descend on the table with banana leaves and all different types of food which they put onto the banana leave for you to eat, some of them are savoury some of them are sweet but all of it is gorgeous and it is very inexpensive highly recommended definitely go
365 Days sadya, good quality stuff and excellent customer service. Recommended Go, especially on lunch time.
The food supplied was tasty. Lot of verities of dosa. It is worth trying different verities. The ambiance is also good.
Located in the middle of the city, just under 2 km from the railway station, this is a good place to experience the traditional Kerala vegetarian meals.
The food was delicious and served in a clean atmosphere. The Waiters and the owner are very friendly and offer very homely service.  The warm water in the beginning of the meal and the baby bananas at the end of the meal add the mothers touch as per the name.
Mothers is undoubtedly the best vegetarian restaurant in Trivandrum and also affordable. Few Europeans find it. Tradtional Kerala food. A Thali which is a collection of flavor sensations. It is also an experience to eat there. Food is served continuously. The banana leaf is full of food. Guaranteed you are not hungry after a visit.
We visited the restaurant with family. The food is excellent with different varieties of dosa. We could not get Sadya i.e authentic kerela veg meal, as it is only served in the afternoon. All in all excellent place to have food.
Gem of a place, esp if you are a vegetarian visiting Trivandrum. The south Indian food is amazing. I esp loved their Chilli Parotha, it was spicy, but so innovative and tasty that we couldn't put it down. The place is clean and well maintained. Service speedy and courteous. There is a security guard outside who helps if patrons arrive in rain (which was so useful when I visited). There is some parking outside, but gets filled pretty fast as it's not enough for everybody that visits. They accept cards, and the menu items are priced alright.
Worth the money spent. Served in the traditional banana leaf and food is tasty too. The ambience though not so great is still ok.
This restaurant offers "Very Good" Kerala Sadhya 365 days, quality is just awesome, they serve plenty, have many curries and four payasam, and many more, on our last visit it was costing INR 200+, I felt it slightly expensive, neatness is good they have space to accommodate many people at a time, parking is bit difficult, service is good, generally staffs are helpful and friendly
This restaurant came as a pleasent surprise for serving the authentic Kerala veg delicacies all round the year.Literally a 24 course meal ,with varying scintillating tastes,served very religiously and affectionately by the attending waiters,and to top it all the detailed familiarisation of the food served and it's ayurvedic connections ,by Mr.Sanal, the owner was the topping on the cake ,made the food very interesting.Wonderful satiating and very tasty food makes one feel linger on for more visits to this Wonderful restaurant.Its also known and famous for its 200 types of dosas and various other south Indian delicacies.Neat n clean restaurant to savour the food of "GODS OWN LAND".The ayurvedic warm concoction served as drinking water with its earthy flavour ,the sweet appetizers .First half of the meal followed by 4 course sweet servings, payasams -- prathamam,dal kheer ,pineapple payasam,washed finally with poli sewai payasam,a unique combination.Thereafter starts the second half of the meal,which ends with rasam and buttermilk.The restaurant staff serves the whole course in its unique sequence of ayurveda.After gorging in this 24 course meal,the urge to have more never dies. And the best part is one doesn't feel over eaten .Literally food prepared with mothers' affection,a must visit restaurant if one happens to visit Trivandrum.Thanks Mr.Sanal for keeping our traditional food live.Sure with this type of preparations King Mahabali will not miss a chance to visit his praja and enjoy Sadhya.
Though Mother's Veg Plaza is famous for its Lunch Meal/Sadhya, I must say that all the other dishes that they serve are equally quite good. We came here with our Office Team for Dinner after watching a movie. That day we ordered many variety of dishes. I personally loved the Mother's Special Dosa. It was a unique preparation mixed with noddles and vegetables, which was made into a masala and served with the Dosa.  Overall, quite satisfied and happy with the experience there. Execllent place for a Family Dinner. Everyone, must visit this place at least once, especially the vegetarians, who will be in for a treat !
A very gud vegetarian restaurant out there .. authentic Kerala Sadhya is too good... Parking can be a problem sometimes.. too crowd at afternoon time.
Excellent place where authentic kerelite lunch is served on banana leaves. A pure veg joint. Variety of dishes ( more than 50) Which had to be eaten in a particular sequence. The owner explained us all the items on the plate and how this ayurvedic meal should be eaten. Excellent place for vegetarians.
Love to say about Mothers Veg Plaza, the food and ambiance is really good and they maintain the taste and style of the items ever since I have been to the restaurant for the first time in 2013. The Thali meals is a real sadya and I like the white rice and side dishes and the payasam too. The Masala dosa and ghee roast are very soft and so are the other items. The restaurant has good seating and is air -conditioned, crowded during lunch time but worth waiting for few minutes for a seat.
You will be pampered with the vegetarian Sadya meals here specially if you are choosing the premium sadya with a variety of curries and payasams. The place could get crowded toward lunch time and could be lively. One issue here is the parking which is very much limited and there is a no parking zone in front of the restaurant.The food has quality and is keeping up with the times except that the new tax for a/c has pushed up the price a wee bit!!
Visited few weeks back with N Indian family. Service was very good. Staff took time to politely and sweetly explain about the items we ordered. And not to tell about the taste. Awesome !! Very tasty Atmosphere was good, cleanliness good... This visit we liked Dosa varieties...Superb. My Pune friends told, "Uncle, sometimes send us "Parcel Dosa" from here"
You will get an authentic Sadya according to traditional south Kerala style. There are other food items and the preparation is good, but the Sadya stands out as a jewel. The payasams are really good and are available for takeaway,
The sadya is very tasty and worth the price.Real Thiruvithamkoor sadya.The dosa varieties are also tasty and novel.The staff are polite and ready to explain about each and every dish.
Sadya at mothers veg plaza is best and very delicious.There is rush in the peak time.We should taken coupon for the meals.There are different varieties of meals and dosas they serve.
The traditional Kerala lunch, known as 'Sadya' can be had from here. It's the sadya which makes this restaurant so popular. There are varieties of Dosa dishes in the evening. It's worth visiting here
Mother's veg plaza , wow tasty vegetarian items , we all like the taste of various foods, good service from staff and management
good staff, good food and the best part owner himself will check each table for any help required...
Good vegiterian food,clean and neat atmosphere reasonable rate,specially south indian good ,special meals
Yummy food. Delicious grape juice. Nice appam, the place was so busy that they refused to serve dishes that take relatively long to prepare, Sunday evening rush perhaps. We will have to go again to try these out. Guests are served small bananas after food to help them sleep tight after having eaten so much. Good experience!
It was a lovely exp. did not know how to eat sadhya. The person called Sanal was more than helpful. Ate so much can't imagine . But not all heavy. Keep up the good work
Lot of space in a ground floor layout of tables and chairs. Nothing special about ambience and the food is pure veg & very tasty. The dosas are great and some good puttu variety.....dosas like the Mumbai roadside 100 variety dosa types.  Traditional meals are a big draw but can get better at crowd management given they have been operating in such environment for long now.  Definitely worth visiting if u have time in case having to wait at entry. If u r small group you may actually get seated much faster as there are large number of tables and chairs.
I will cherish my visit to mother's veg plaza. it was really nice to have the traditional kerala meal on a banana leaf with four different payasams( traditional dessert of kerala). I could barely move after the meal though as it can be very filling
They have regular and can special sadhya...if you want to have a lot of items and payasam..opt for special sadhya.You can go and have it between 11am and 3.00pm everyday and sadhya is served smoothly and in an orderly way with less time taken .you can get parcel also everyday and also for onam etc..awsome food if younlove teh traditional Kerala curry of sadhya...its near bakery junction in front of park hotel ..the junction where it meets road from Spencer jn and other side road from palayam t bakery junction flyover...under the fly over side...
Best hotel in trivandrum to taste traditional kerela food "Sadhya". In single meal, we have tasted 4 different Payasam's and all traditional foods. Best part they will explain what food it is and how to eat. Owner himself will come to your table and explain about food. One of the best person, that's why his hotel getting many good reviews and awards.  Tips: ------ Have a light breakfast in the morning Reach 'Mothers Veg Plaza' around 12 pm. (Google maps location was accurate) Buy 1 kerela sadhya meals coupon (Rs. 180 - Unlimited traditional food) Enjoy your lunch  Note: They have good space for parking
Good place for Kerala style 'sadya' (meals) on banana leaf. It is completely vegetarian. The dishes were tasty, there is lot of crowd whenever I went for lunch, difficulty to get table if you go in a group, because of the crowd.It is not very costly too.
One of the best locations to get traditional ONAM SADHYA in the city of Trivandrum. Centrally located. Seasonal rush gives bit difficulty in parking and to get seats in the dining hall. Tasty vegetarian side dishes surrounds the rice over a big banana leaf.Delicious payasam as well. They serve the vegetarian sadhya round the year.
This may the only place in Trivandrum where you will get Onasadya any day. Food quality and taste are good.
Mothers veg plaza is located inside the city near bakery junction. It has limited car parking and rest of the vehicles can be parked on near by road. Highlight of this restaurant is Kerala style sadya and variety dosa's. There are several types of dosa's and oothappam (kerala style dosa). Ambiance is good. You can expect rush during weekends.
was a bit disappointed.. I have had better meals at lesser price. Could be because my expectations were a bit on the higher side
Had a great lunch over here. Owner of the restaurant detailed us on every item served in sadhya ..how and in which order one should eat. It was a unique experience.
The best place in Trivandrum for the traditional "sadya". Quite crowded during lunch time. Getting a place to park may also be difficult. In the evening they serve dosas and other veg fare and in the evening snacks. Okay stuff, but nothing to match their sadya. Home delivery is available.
The meal was tasty,wholesome with around 35 items. the service was prompt with personal care and clean premises despite the huge rush.
Sadya is the traditional kerala meal taken as lunch. Its like the north indian thali, but will a difference. There is an order to eat the curries.  Typically there are about 8 to 15 curries server in a sadya. Due to these complexities, is rarely available in its original form in restaurants.  This is where Mother's Veg Plaza stands out. A typical meal costs ₹200/-. But it's almost worth it.  Visit and experience authentic kerala sadya.
This is the vest vegetarian restaurant in the Trivandrum. I recommend to have lunch of Kerala style on banana leaf. Staff of the restaurant is friendly in nature. Want to visit again while in Trivandrum.
if you planning for Typical Kerala Veg Food, Visit this place they offer good food at affordable rate,
This place is supposedly good for its South Indian dishes and its lunch sadhya. went here to have the lunch sadhya. typical Kerala style restaurant; big dining space with tables and chairs arranged next to each other. the place was crowded for lunch ( i guess with people from the near by offices). we had the traditional sadhya on banana leaves. the taste of the different curries and side dishes was average, nothing to rave about nor to complain. I have had definitely much better ones than this. However, the one part i couldn't stand at all was the attitude of the waiters, not just one almost all of them. We were asking them questions on the name of the dishes or for additional helping, the attitude of them were like as if we were disturbing or bothering them. They werent even bothered to reply to our queries, they will look at us and have a expression which said have your food and vacate.They was this one guy who looked like the manager or the owner he was the only guy who was very courteous and attentive to our needs as well as that of the other diners. Overall, I dont plan on going back there again.
Right in the center of town, near Bakery circle, This is a restaurant you must eat in if you are a vegetarian. Ask particularly a Sadhya meal. Most probably, you will have one of the family explaining the sequence in which to eat the nearly thirty varieties of dishes costing just about Rs 200 per person.. Every dish is delicious. Don't forget to ask for the Ayurvedic significance and the owner will explain.
The dosas here are to die for, especially genie dosa (hope I spelled that right :P). It's a must eat at place for food addicts. Love the dosas and the variety in which they come. Sadhya is also very good especially the payasam :) The place is much more hygienic compared to other vegetarian restaurants. It's always bustling with people no matter what time of the day it is, so please do not plan a get together here with family or friends. Just dine and leave :) and let others too get a chance at enjoying the food there. The only drawback was one of the cashier here who is pretty irritant most of the time. They do have home delivery as well and also cater.  P.S. - do not take away dosas as they tend to get soggy... :(
Mother's plaza is renowned for its Kerala Sadya. Great traditional spread in reasonable rates. Authentic sadya is served in banana leaf with payasams.Service is also quick. Highly recommended.
This is my 3rd visit to this restaurant. As was my previous review, the service is still pathetic even when there is only average crowd. I even overheard a customer asking the service assistant whether he would have to wait until tomorrow to have his food served. Now they are also duping the customers by over charging in the pretext of GST. Attaching a bill with GST calculation. They are deducting 7% on the list price as tax refund on pre- GST price ( says that the finance minister has instructed to deduct 7%) and then instead of calculating 18% GST on the amount arrived at after deducting 7%, they are adding 18% on the list price, there by fooling the customer and overcharging. I do not foresee this restaurant improving service and now have started overcharging as well in the guise of GST.
I had lunch from Mothers veg,i mean Sadhya in malayalam.There are two prices of sadya avilable one for 180/- and 120/-.For me they offer different types of vegitable side dishes in banna leaf.The food is awesom,its take time to finish everything.Finally they offer four types of payasam,one payasam with boli,its different feel to me,first time i had this type.  Mothers veg walkable distance from Bakery Junction,Trivandrum.
VEGETARIAN, HYGEINIC, Exceellent Menu, Tasty Food, Personal Attention, 100 types of Dosa Must try Kerala Sadhya Meal .....
If you go to see a place , you should experience their tradition too. Mother's veg plaza offer you the traditional Kerala food in traditional style..on banana leaf.great taste. Wonderful service, fantastic staff..happy to serve you, ayurvedic food. A must visit
It was a very good vegetarian restaurant. But now the service and food quality had deteriorated. Pros : 1) Ample parking space behind margin free market opposite to the restaurant. The service of the security personnel at parking space was excellent. 2) Lots of dosa options Cons : 1) The service person / waiters were not sure of what was present in the hotel. We ordered one dish and the serving person (not the waiter who took the order) served something else and argued that the dish was authentic. 2) The hotel was always over crowded. Still not able to understand the reason. May be the parking space was the main reason. 3) The ambience was very poor. It was like a huge hall having adjacent tables and chairs.
This is one of the best sadhya's you can enjoy while in Kerala.Its quite elaborate and is excellent value for money.They keep on serving and at times its difficult to relish all the delicacies.It'll be a good idea to have a light breakfast or skip it altogether if you plan to go there.The highlight is four different payasam's served in succession on the plantain leaf,the final one being vermicelli on boli.
Visited this place because of the high positive interest by other reviewers. This place is a hoax….dishing out a wannabe sadhya spread that is tastless and an insult to the real Kerala cuisine. With due respects to other reviewers who have appreciated the food here, I must say with all humility that you guys need to get a crash course in understanding and appreciating authentic Kerala cuisine. The alarming part of the meal is it is actually positioned as an ‘Ayurvedic Meal’. One of the restaurant management guys goes around the tables of unsuspecting and naïve first timers to Kerala food and emphasizes the ayurvedic properties of the vast insipid spread and how it has to be consumed. C’mon guys…get real….stop this con game. Most of the patrons to this hoax of a restaurant are essentially tourists. You don’t see the locals here. That’s because the locals know the local food!!!! If there would be a law against serving ‘pretentious’ food, this place would be on the top of the offenders list. Highly avoidable.
Located in bakery junction Good food Best pricing Good verity of deserts Both red rice and white rice is available suitable for all south indians
Awesome. Traditional food at its best. Special treatment and updates especially if you not from Kerala. The owner himself took the effort to guide me throughout the meal- what to eat and how to eat. Interesting place !!! Loved it!! Courteous staff......Place is a complete value for money. Must visit for everyone who visits Trivandrum
Good vegetarian place. Different tasty varieties of dosa is a specialty, but at a cost. Clean place. Easy to reach. Limited parking but the helpful parking attendant will find a way to accommodate!
The best place for vegetarian with a wide varieties of dishes... hats off to "sadhya"... Good ambience...
Excellent is a lesser word. One needs to visit and taste Sadhya ( Full course authentic Kerala meal on banana leaf). Worth it....
Supposedly a very popular eating joint, but experience there were unpleasant. Thanks to the overcrowded arrangement and the messy waiting queue, you are made to wait at any which place you can find to wait, and then while you eat there are others looking over your shoulders almost urging you to eat quickly. Altogether forgettable. And the food too is not that great.
Visiting this place for the second time. Food is tasty. Service can be improved. Location is good with ample car park
You have to try lunch which is so special (havent tried anyother dish) with lot varieties and tastes good. Must try : Payasam,sambar
Great place with good food .Amazing traditional spread for.an nominal amount of 180 rs .Unlimited food at it's traditional best .top class service with amazing set of staff who take out their time to explain the sadya and the dishes ..  A must go place in trivandrum cheers team
I stayed in Trivandrum for 10 days in April. After going out for dinner every day in different hotels I have come to this place for dinner. My initial experience made me visit again but to my surprise on a late night dinner, I was shocked to find the curry dishes were adulterated. Immediately I have reported to the order takers. They were apologetic and offered to serve another dish which I refused. Customer service is another issue at this restaurant. The Manager who is also manages the cash counter is a very grumpy lady who is not interested to know what is going on in the restaurant. Since then I avoided going there.
Food is good, but Service is very very poor. Owner is acting too much. He is not a good manager. He dont know how to treat the customers. I was waiting for food nearly 1hr after order. He not at all bother...
It is quite rare even in Kerala to find a good restaurant that serves authentic hygienic and tasty Kerala Sadya (vegetarian feast) on a banana leaf. Mother's Veg Plaza has addressed this gap. I really enjoyed the food served here with passion and a smile by the friendly staff. I went with my mom and aunts and we had a good time at peak lunch hour.
Every human being who comes to Trivandrum should have a Sadya Meal (a traditional extremely enjoyable festival, ceremonial, wedding meal). And, Mothers Veg Plaza is the only place I know which lets you have that any day, without having to attend a wedding. The meal is excellent. Service is fast, though a bit messy.  The downside is the crowd. It is awfully crowded, you may have to share you table with others. And, eating food in a rush, with strangers is not my idea of a nice, pleasant meal. Sadly no one serves the sadya in more pleasant circumstances in Trivandrum. The one in BTM, Kochi (Ernakulam) was more enjoyable.
Its an authentic Malayali Veg Restaurant which serves food in Banana Leaves. The comprises of all the Rasas prescribed in Indian Vedic Literatures namely Sattv, Rajasik and Tamsik. There is an particular order in which you eat food the Waiters there will properly explain you how and in which order you should eat what. Food is very tasty ( even for a diehard Non vegetarian like me) and the way the staff takes intrest in serving is very heart warming.
On our 10 day trip to Kerala We wanted to experience a traditional Sadhya meal. After looking on trip advisor we were lucky that our driver's friend had also recommended this place to eat.  When we arrived the restaurant was very busy but the floor manager was very good and asked us to take a seat. It gave a chance to see how it worked  After gaining a ticket for the meal which only cost 180 rupees (just over £2 uk sterling) we started our meal. The table was cleaned first and then the cleaned banana leaves came out. We wiped them down with the tissue provided. Then along came a staff who served us the meal There were at least 4 types of chutneys, 3 types of vegetables, along with rice, papdad, banana and sweet things. As the floor manager explained half the rice had yogurt mix put over it and then when that was finished we had a dal/sambal over it. There wer3 4 courses to the dessert and you had to use the banana to mix it in. The meal ended with a yogurt type drink and rasam.  Overall it was the best vegetarian meal that we tasted and extremely good value for money.  If you ever come to Kerala I would urge you to try a traditional meal at this restaurant.
The restaurant offers a wide variety of vegetarian dishes. The main dish is the Kerala Sadya if you are visiting during noon time. The restaurant also offers more than 100 types of Dosa. The restaurant is very clean and nice service too. Highly recommended for pure veggies.
Went 4 times for lunch. The true kerala lunch on bansna leaf. Really tasty food. Restaurant is very clean and good service. Highly recommended to all.
I may give 5 stars if they consider improving the ambience of the restaurant. The food is fresh and great. The whole restaurant is clean and good staff also. But you will not get privacy while you are in the restaurant. Old and traditional table and chair arrangements and wherever you turn you will see people. Except the privacy and ambience, this is a great vegitarian restaurant in the city.
If you are looking for Kerala Style sadhya, this is the right place to be. Go there before 12.30 PM to avoid heavy rush.
I happen to visit Mothers Veg Plaza in late-March 2017, along with my parents. We reached the restaurant around noon and crowd was yet to start flowing. The restaurant has limited parking for cars, however it has good ambiance and is maintained pretty well inside. We thought of tasting their Kerala Sadhya - something most talked about.  Soon a waiter, served us in banana/plantain leaves, about some 20 plus dishes like Parippu vada, Sharkara Upperi, Chips, 3 different types of pickles, followed by pachadi, kichadi, aviyal, olan, thoran, potato curry, pappadam, etc. along with steaming hot Rice (brown/white based on our choice) and Sambar. Next to serve were 4 different types of Payasam, which included Semia, Ada, Pineapple payasam etc. along with Boli. Post this itself once might feel heavy. Post which, they serve us Pulissery, Rasam and Butter milk towards the end. In between the Owner/Manager of the restaurant was courteous in enquiring about the taste of the food and quality.  Price for such an elaborate meal was 180Rs, which we felt to be reasonable. Would definitely recommend others to try Mother Veg - one of the best Pure Veg restaurants in Trivandrum.
Sadya in Kerala means food or meal.  A yummilicious restaurant for enjoying vegeterian Kerala meal.  The food is offered on a banana leaf, with more than 25 items that are offered. I will try to share as much as I can:  Snack: Yellow banana wafer, dry turmeric fried patty, Kerala papadam, and Banana Pickles: Mango, Lime pickle, a Tamarind based chutney Raita/Pachadi: Pineapple based, Only curd based, Mixed veg and one more Rice: Thick unpolished white rice and polished rice Roti/Puri: Smack in your face...you don't get it here :-) Vegetables/Sabji: Potato, Tendli/Kundru/Ivy Gourd, and 2 more which I can't remember Sambhar, Rasam and 2 more liquid based gravies  Sweet Dish: 4 types of Payassam..yes, you read it right, 4 types and all super yummy Buttermilk for having a good digestion after such a meal  The people serving the food are always ready to serve you as much as you want, and few of them were always smiling when offering food, as I kept asking them in English and they also realised I wasn't from the state or knew their language  All of the above for only Rs.180 (which as per Kerala standards is on the higher side), was definitely worth the food.  Definitely a must recommend if you are around this locality or can manage to travel a little (as Trivandrum anyways doesn't need you to travel a lot for more places).
Good food, good service, very nice people one to one approach and even you get advice how to have the sadhya dishes. Very nice ambience... best food on best rate...love the sadhya.....
This restaurant was adjudged 'The Best' from a score of hotels during the last Onam festival (2016), lots of lip smacking payasams (that deserts for Non-Malayalees).  I have had the pleasure of having them cater for a family function, for which they provided excellent food. Will order again if the occasion arises.  Please remember this is a Pure Vegetarian restaurant, so no fish or other Non-vegetarian items.  All in all an excellent experience.  Reducing one point because of their seating arrangements, this could be made a little more comfortable.  All the best Mothers Veg Plaza.
Usually, visit MVP for dinner. There are not wider choices as it a vegetarian restaurant. There is a long list of dosa varieties. Kerala steamed puttu, appam, Chinese and north Indian food are also served. Not suggested trying Chinese varieties. Fresh juices are not available and mostly restrained to mint lime and ice cold tea. When it comes to lunch the restaurant is generally crowded and good place to try authentic veg food of Kerala. Kerala Sadya special. Parcel service is available. Accepts Credit/Debit card and Paytm for cash. Parking is very limited and one need to manage by parking along roadsides
You can get variety of dosas. Tasteful too. Only veg dishes available. Good service.at times the when waiters are new, dishes get delayed.
food is delicious and tasty ,but the lady servers there are conjus and act as deaf and dump and will turned to our side only if we call more than two times as in court .Meals Rates to be reduced
The restaurant is generally busy in the noon. The number of assorted curries and pickles that goes along with the rice is really astounding. This is a favourite place during the famous Onam days when the Malayalees tend to splurge their clothes and ornaments. Those who do not have time to prepare the sumptuous meals during Onam order their meals from this restaurant and they welcome their friends from other states to enjoy the meal.
A place where you can enjoy the real taste of Kerala traditional meals.They serves lot of delicious curries ,rice and different varieties of payasam.Actually the restaurant was in a heavy rush in lunch tme so we were in a hurry to finish the meals.Any way the the veg sadya was very tasty.
Great place, very friendly people. Very good climate. Very comfortable and beutifully constructed locality
Yes lots of varieties of dosa is available. Nice taste too. Their noodle disappeared is what I liked most. The ambience is OK. Again it's kinda a busy restaurant. Good for vegetarian dishes. Nice place for a veg dinner
We were recommended this place by a fellow passenger on our trip to India.We had the kerala sadhya (banana leaf buffet). This was the best meal we had in India. Our kids want to visit Trivandrum again just to have a meal here. The food was absolutely delicous , freshly prepared, more than 20 dishes served with so much love by the staff and the owner . even my husband who is not a big fan of south Indian cuisine absolutely loved the food. I'm not sure about the rest of the menu as we didnt try it but the kerala sadhya here was simply divine.
The food was delicious and priced right. Kerala Sadhya was sumptuous. However be careful if you ask for an extra serving of Boli (dessert) as it is charged Rs 10 in addition to what you pay for the meal.
Went ter few times only dosas were good.but was terrible not at all cooked.last time ordered paneer butter masala,the curry was terrible . Being a veg hotel they don't even know how to prepare paneer...another point is that the plates were also not clean.
I had vegiterian lunch once from this hotel, it is situated Bekery junction . Price is reasonable . Big crowd at noon time
Its normal kerala Sadhya and good dosas ....I feel it's over hyped...Nothing very special...The place is always crowded but service prompt and fast..Hope they have a AC wing too some times it gets too hot...Can visit once for experience.. Parking is an issue....We also had their catered food at an even during Onam unfortunately it was below my expectation!
The restaurant situated near RBI Office is one of the best Vegeterian Restaurant partially as it is awesome for it's Kerala Sadhya. But if you expect south Indian Snacks like Dosas you may get cold dosas or preprepared heated dosas. Pricewise bit over priced restaurant.
First time i visiting this place was on mid of 2016, and found i was not served with lot of dishes. Visiting again on jan 2017 first week, and liked the traditional kerala sadya served in banana leaves that too with 4 payasams. Superb. I liked it and gone back again next weekend.When you are in a feel of having sadya, go this place. Owner is also very helpful and i have seen he giving tips to north indians/foreigners how to eat a kerala sadya.  Note:  Each sadya cost 160 rs  And they serve sadya until 4:30 pm,which is exciting,but better be thr before 3 pm to enjoy the sadya hot !
Situated in the heart of Trivandrum, this is a restaurant that serves very tasty Vegetarian fare. The meal, served on the typical Kerala style on a bananaleaf is resplendent with all the items usually included in the Kerala Meal (Sadya).The meal will make you comfortable, not feel heavy. Same is the story with the other snack items served, hot, crispy, tasty. Ghee Roasts are made out of real ghee. Spacious and neat one can visit the place with friends or family . Parking of vehicles is also not a challenge. The place provides the typical motherly or homely dishes at very reasonable rates. A must visit .
A bit overpriced restaurant that serves 99 types of dosa and "the Kerala sadya" . It's pure veg and may be a good place to eat just once in your life. This is because the curries for the sadya never change, they are the same everyday.
They have a varity of about 101 types of dosas, which attracts all ages of people. A very good verity of all types of veg dishes. The veg meals is one of the best in thiruvananthapuram.
This is the place to get the best Kerala sadhya ,They serve it with the best dishes and they also guide the order in which each dishes should be tried . The dilkush dosa was something very delicious . This place will bit crowded during lunch and dinner time ,but the wait is worth it.
The place is clean and tidy. They have an amazing variety of Dosas on offer prepared in an open kitchen. The service is good. A nice pure vegetarian place. Not too expensive. Good value for money.
It's a good option for Kerala Sadya. The food is tasty with 4 varieties of payasam and boli. The place is crowded and be there early to ensure your seats!
My host recommended this place, it was busy when i arrived, Rs 100 for sadya, it was delicious, they were adding more while i was eating. Definitely will come back
I along with my family visited the mother veg Plaza restaurant and the food was amazing the owner himself came to explain each and everything to us and even told us the sequins to have the food the taste of the food was amazing the service was also nice. Sachi bolu toh naa hogyi thi khana kha kha k
Kerala being predominantly sea food favourite foodies we were worried that it will be difficult to find a good pure vegetarian restaurant.  But as Mother's Veg Plaza was highly recommended by fellow TripAdvisor members we decided to give it a try. And believe us we went there 4 times during our 2 days stay at Trivandrum.  The variety of Dosas is mind boggling. And whichever item we tried were different and very tasty.  And the lunch ( Sadya) was simply outstanding. There were so many varieties of sambars, rasams and payasams that we had to over eat. It was a wonderful experience.  We will recommend to everyone and come back here again whenever in Trivandrum.
I tasted the Best Onam Sadya here. Mother's Veg Plaza is located in Bakery Junction. Onam Sadya - Upperi, Pappad, Banana, 3 types of Pickles, 4 types of Kichady, Vegetables, Aviyal, Kootu, Sambar, Dal, Rasam, Curd, 4 types of Kheer, Vada. All just for 160rs. Best Lunch i have ever had. Value for Money.
The food here is good. But I will suggest to have only south Indian food and leave the Chinese food to try at some Chinese restaurant only. The soups are horrible. We left both ,the sweet corn and the hot and sour unfinished after tasting it. But the dosas, the appams, the rice and dal were really great. They have more than 100 dosas varieties and a very expansive south Indian food menu. one thing that I want to share with my readers is that if u are looking for eating on a banana leaf as we all want, then please visit this place before 3pm. They don't serve it in the evening. But the management has to really look into the behaviour and the attitude of the staff. They just don't listen to u. The usual courtesy, the hospitality, the smile , the politeness is not at all there in any of the waiters. Hope they don't bring down the name of this fabulous eating place.
good food. but its was crowded during dinner time and we have to wait and it was lot of rush. but food was tasty and good
Visited Mothers Veg Plaza last week during my Kerala trip. Really worth place to enjoy Onasaddya, the Keralian delight . The owner was very much cordial and was serving the guests as well. Price was 160, but will be increased to 180 from Jan,17.  Dont miss the visit to this place during your Trivandrum visit.  This hotel got ToIs 1st prize during competition, which it really deserves.
Kerala sadya, a vegetarian feast, served on plantain leaf is an integral part of festivals and social gatherings. Priced at Rs. 160/-, the feast, complete with 5 curries, 20 odd side dishes and 4 payasams, is a great value for money.  They have limited parking facilities, so if you are on a 4 wheeler, better to park near museum and walk rest of the distance.  Food tasted okay, but wasn't served hot. Don't expect great ambience either. The place gets really crowded at lunch time, especially on weekends.  Highly recommended for visitors and vegetarian food enthusiasts alike.
IF you want perfect kerala style food, you must visit this place. For rs. 160/- lot of items and sweets were served along with meals. Staff response is also good. you have to wait during peak time. Best veg food i had in kerala.
favorite place for family dining to get kerala experience with sadyaa, value for money and excellent quantity
if in Trivandrum, You must visit Mothers Veg Plaza for traditional kerala style sadya. Mothers plaza team are also friendly and manager helps you understand the speciality of each dish and would make you follow the order on how to consume Kerala Style Sadya. Been there regulary, I would strongly recommend tourists to try Keral Style sadya from Mothers Veg Plaza.
There are two categories of people in the restaurant business. One who do it for money and others who do it for passion. Although it is a pretty crowded place and finding a place to sit is a tough ask it is all worth it for people who wish to enjoy a Kerala Sadhya. The way in which things are served is pretty authentic with a lot of local population enjoying their meals in this place. What set this place apart is the eagerness of the host who on identifying me and my family as an outsider came in and guided us as to how to consume the meal in the best possible manner. His warmth was definitely visible in the quality of food being served. Every bite that we savored upon was an experience in itself. With close to 30 items on the offer we really enjoyed every item. The owner guided me to have the banana with one of the sweet dishes so that its taste can be better enjoyed. The lunch was topped with 3 sweet items and each item was different than the other. The palatable nature of food in any restaurant is in direct proportion to the ethics of the host and this restaurant just proves this point. It is a must visit place for Non Kairalis who wish to enjoy the vegetarian side of Kairali food.
It is a good place for Kerala Sadya with many items full on the planten leaf. Good taste also. It is available parcel also with moderate quantity sufficient for a family.
An outstanding presentation of a saddhya meal. The meal is all about course eating. It begins with rice and dal. Moves on to rice and sambhar. Then rice and kadhi. Then rasam and then lassi to end. A varieties of chutneys ,vegetables and sweets flow through in between. The best part is you don't feel heavy after eating it. And the experience is novel and pleasurable. If in Trivandrum- Don't miss it.
so variety of doss... good environment good service .....easy parking...best sadya at very reasonable rate.
GREAT Masala dosa is good and lot of variety is there service is good Noon lunch is also good but parking is a problem
In Kerala , to have a good pure vegetarian hotel is quite a difficult one. Thnx to the vegetarian population at Trivandrum, this city is an exception. This restaurant stands tall among the pure vegetarian restaurants here.  This one though famous for its lunch, offers multi cuisine dishes as dinner . Dosa seems to be their USP. The mothers veg special dosa (costing Rs120) is a never miss item. It is a fusion item between the southindian dosa and cheese pizza …  The ambience is calm and quite. Being located in a bye road near Bakery junction, parking may not be a problem, though the restaurant provides parking spot for 4-5 cars only .  The open kitchen concept gives us a feel good factor too…  An average cost may come in the order of Rs150-200 per head
We had a lovely lunch at Mothers Veg Plaza. It was an authentic meal with 4 types of pickles, 4 Raitas, Avial and another vegetable, brown/white rice, Sambhar, Rasam, Papadam, buttermilk, banana and 5 types of Payasams! The best Malyali meal we have had! Very friendly and warm waiters. Very special!
Hotel mothers is a very good option for a south india vegetarian meal. You may need to wait for sometime before you get a seat but that wait is worth. They serve delicious south indian banana leaf sandhya. Must visit if you are in Trivandrum
Recommended place to have food while in Trivandrum.. Try Pizza dosa... Value for money.... Service is slow though..but that is understandable..
Centrally located clean and affordable veg eating place.Kerala special lunch is the most attractive food.
If you are alone this is not a place to go. They only seat 4 per table. Totally disorganized really no one to receive you. You stand there and watch and observe.  Lots of people to serve food. Food seems to be ok but you sit next with totally strange people who eat with hands with different styles.  I was there to have a Kerala Oonu experience In a Banana Leaf. Some if the items are served bare hands like plantain chips, Vada etc. It was ok just for once.
